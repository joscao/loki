    This function checks whether a linear system of equations in the form of matrix x [operator] right_hand_side
    can be split into independent one-dimensional problems. The number of problems is determined by the
    number of variables (the row number of the matrix).

    the right-hand side vector. It splits the system into assumed independent one-dimensional problems.
